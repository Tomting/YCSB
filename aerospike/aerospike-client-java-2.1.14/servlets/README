Servlet Example

This is a simple servlet showing interactions with the Aerospike database 
through an HTTP interface. The source code can be imported into your IDE 
and/or built using Maven.

  mvn package
  cp target/aerospike.war <tomcat directory>/webapps	

To clarify the interface and the usage, a web page that 
does AJAX requests to the servlet is provided. 

  http://<host>:<port>/aerospike/example.html

The servlet exports a REST interface where keys in the Aerospike database 
are expressed as namespace/set/keyname triples. 
To fetch a particular key:

  http://<host>:<port>/aerospike/client/<namespace>/<set>/<keyname>

To set a value, one POSTs to the same URL, adding parameters 'bin' and 'value' 
to specify the bin and the value. The response sent back is in JSON format, 
of the form:

  { "response": {<binname>:<value>, ... <binname>:<value>}, "generation":<generation>}

The servlet has been tested under Tomcat 6.
